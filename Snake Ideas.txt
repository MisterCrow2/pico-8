Snake Ideas
	Countdown before start
	Spawn food inside edges of map
	Don't spawn food on top of each other
	Don't spawn food on player
	Food spoils
	Levels
	Different sized food
	Snake Dash
		Speed boost (fast ramp up, ease out)
		Can go thru self
		Solves problem of slow early game and opens up movement mid-late game
		Hold and release instead of immediate fire?
			If snake trail colors change over time, hold could bullet time, evident from snake
			colors slowing down
			Hold and release could show end position ghost
		If works, "Snake Dash" good name for game?

Polish ideas
	Snake trail colors do things when eating shit
	Width can grow?
	Damage numbers
	Different food

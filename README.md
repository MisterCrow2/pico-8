# pico-8
Learning and playing around with Pico-8. Everything in here is beyond extremely rough; it's a combination of learning, prototyping, and just playing around. I would never use anything like this in production code.

## snake.p8
Snake Dash, my first Pico-8 game! A prototype for a Snake clone with a dash mechanic. Boilerplate provided by https://github.com/ojdon/pico8-boilerplate.
